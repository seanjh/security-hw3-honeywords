### CS 5435: Security and Privacy in the Wild (Fall 2015)

## Instructions
The scripts are split across 3 separate files, each implementing algorithms for the 3 respective problems.

Problem 1:

    python genp1.py n input_file output_csv


Problem 2:

    python genp2.py n input_file output_csv

Problem 3:

    python genp3.py n input_file output_csv


## Requirements
The scripts for problems 2 and 3 both require a local copy of the RockYou password list. This file should be available in plaintext in a file named ```rockyou-withcount.txt```. Each line of this file should include a digit, representing the number of uses, and the password itself, separated by whitespace.
